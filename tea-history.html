          <h1>History of Tea</h1>
          <p>Tea, also know as Chai (depending on your linguistic persuasion), has satisfied the thirsts of all manner of peoples over the millennium. First discovered by the Neanderthal Grog, circa 45000 BCE, Tea initially served as a ritualistic drink for the naive, cave dwelling peoples of Western Europe. As the Neanderthals were gradually wiped out by modern humans through a mix of interbreeding and genocide, their tea drinking practices were subsumed by the victorious Homo Sapiens. Tea culture then expanded via the typical routes to the nascent river civilizations of the Yellow, Nile, Indus, and Euphrates.</p>
          <p>The practices of Tea drinking and its associated cultures are as wide and varied as humanity itself. Hearkening back to its roots, Tea often finds itself as the centerpiece of formal occasions. From the Tea Ceremonies of Japan to the Afternoon Teas of England, Tea serves a critical role as the drink of choice for demonstrating your cultural affluence without cracking into your top shelf spirits. It is likely that Tea will retain its position of beverage prominence for years to come.</p>
